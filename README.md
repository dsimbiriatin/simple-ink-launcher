# About

The project started as an idea for a simple replacement of the standard InkBook launcher along with its default reader application. This launcher rather tries to be a thin, seamless layer between the device and a reader application of choice (e.g. [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader), [ALReader](http://alreader.com/), etc.), than a feature-rich swiss army knife (like [RelaunchX](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.gacode.relaunchx)).

# Key features
- E-ink friendly design
- Ability to define default reader application
- Run reader application automatically during device startup
- Hide some applications, so they are not visible on the launcher
- Apply custom icons theme (ADW launcher themes are currently supported)
- Wi-Fi, backlight toggles available on the launcher toolbar

# Compatibility
Designed to look nice on InkBook devices but technically compatible with any Android-based reader running **version 4.2+**
